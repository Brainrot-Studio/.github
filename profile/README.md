# Brainrot Studio LLC

This is the official GitHub for Brainrot Studio LLC, a small development studio focused on building things we actually care about. Mostly games, sometimes tools, always something we’d want to use ourselves.

## About

Brainrot Studio is just a few people who like making stuff. We're gamers, programmers, and people who like experimenting. We’re not trying to be flashy, we just want to make things that are fun, useful, or both.

## What We Care About

- Make things we’d actually play or use  
- Keep it fun, creative, and personal  
- Don’t overcomplicate it

That’s pretty much it. Check out the projects. More coming when they’re ready.
